h1. Lift Scripts

This is my first foray into "Lift":http://liftweb.net/ and I thought that the command to generate a project was pretty long:

<pre><code>mvn archetype:generate -U                                   \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=net.liftweb                            \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=lift-archetype-basic                \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.0                                    \
  -DremoteRepositories=http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases \
  -DgroupId=$GROUP_ID                                       \
  -DartifactId=$ARTIFACT_ID                                 \
  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
</code></pre>

What do programmers do?  Automate!

<pre><code>$ lift gen com.mycompany twitter
</code></pre>

I also have shortcuts for starting Jetty and running the tests:

<pre><code>$ lift start
$ lift test
</code></pre>

These two are pretty minor, but this could be the beginning of something.

h1. Installation

The code comes packaged into it's own entity.  To install on your machine:

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/francois/lift-scripts.git
$ cd lift-scripts
$ ant install
</code></pre>

The install task will symlink all binaries from bin/ to your ~/bin, minus the .sh extension.

h1. License

This code is placed in the public domain.
